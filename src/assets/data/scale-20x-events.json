There are multiple horror stories of developers choosing a NoSQL database and later regretting it. But now you can get the best of both worlds with JSON in PostgreSQL. In this session, I cover the benefits of using JSON, anti-patterns to avoid, and an example of how to use JSON in Postgres."

Newer tools like K3s which allow building minimalist environments have made it much easier to run in a \"I just want some containers\" mode. This opens the door to starting on a small Kubernetes setup and being able to slowly grow it over time as your requirements and complexity increase."

I will share my experiences and lessons learned that have shaped my approach to DevOps."

In this talk, I will present a different approach to debugging, one that takes advantage of our programming abilities and utilizes them to find bugs faster all while improving our software development and design skills."

      "abstract": "Alex set out to kill the banality in \"educational hardware platforms\" when he created the Nugget: a cat-shaped console for cybersecurity and hardware beginners. He wanted to create an interactive product that would make it fun to learn daunting topics like network security and USB hacking through a cute interface, while also offering utility for seasoned hackers & makers. In this talk, Alex discusses the challenges he faced in bringing a niche educational hardware platform to market, and talks about how he scaled this project into a successful business through open-source design."

It was originally called that precisely because it straddled those two worlds. \n \n Yet most firmware is no longer firm, it's more like tofu and exists in firm, semi-firm, and soft states. Current FSF policy that allows proprietary firmware is based on burned-on-chip, write-once firmware from a few decades ago. Most firmware today is field-upgradable and closer to software. This talk will discuss how the modern state of \"firm\"ware demands new free software policy, and start a discussion on what that policy could be."

This gives us magical powers of understanding complex systems behavior without compromising on security and performance. But there is a catch: eBPF is complex. To build your own tools using eBPF, you need to know a lot about the intricacies of low-level programming. In this talk, we will learn more about the powers that eBPF gives developers. We will discuss how we can use visual programming concepts to make building eBPF programs more simple, intuitive and accessible."

Devcontainers are a great way to take your development environment and make it replicatable for contributors but locally and via the web.

Threats have changed, but so have your options for tools and services to use. Now that California law codifies our right to check out how our personal information is shared, that means we have an opportunity to  optimize our privacy toolkits and habits, and level up by focusing where it counts. We'll cover topics including ad blocker myths and facts, recommended extensions, and how and when to use your rights under California law."

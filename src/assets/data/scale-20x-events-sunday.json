      "abstract": "Free, CAD, BIM, FEM... what is it and why might I care? \n \n 3D Printing is just one of the simplest things FreeCAD can be used for. With commercial products like Fusion 360 limiting features for free personal use, OpenSource software like FreeCAD become even more important to know and use. \n \n Come and see some of what it can do. Add it to your arsenal of skills. Learn what it is and how to get started. Learn what makes it different from Blender, OpenSCAD and others. Learn about features like what 'parametric' means, and how you can use Python with it."

We will then go over how a simple yet powerful dev workflow can be set up using Crossplane and Kubernetes-based development environments. The talk would cover: \n \n \n What Kubernetes based development environments are, and how Crossplane provisions infrastructure Why developers need the combination of the two for being effective when writing cloud-native applications Demo of setting up a dev workflow"

If you're just starting a new project, or even maybe a new startup, should you use Kubernetes? I say yes! Newer tools like K3s which allow building minimalist environments have made it much easier to run in a \"I just want some containers\" mode. This opens the door to starting on a small Kubernetes setup and being able to slowly grow it over time as your requirements and complexity increase."

      "abstract": "Have you ever started a project and asked - \"should I use a SQL or NoSQL database?\" It’s a big decision. There are multiple horror stories of developers choosing a NoSQL database and later regretting it. But now you can get the best of both worlds with JSON in PostgreSQL. In this session, I cover the benefits of using JSON, anti-patterns to avoid, and an example of how to use JSON in Postgres."

      "topic": "PostgreSQL",
      "abstract": "Of the relational databases, PostgreSQL is fairly unique in the indexing capabilities it offers. While most of us are familiar with the use of indexes to speed performance when filtering on columns, PostgreSQL indexes can do far more than this. This talk will focus on cases where difficult problems were solved through the creative use of indexes. Each of these cases is from an episode in my career."
